            I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are
            looking for a professional, I can tell you I don't have enough experience.
            But what I do have are a broad set of skills, skills I have acquired over
            my 3-4 years as an IT student. Skills that make me a potentially interesting
            candidate for people like you. If you're uninterested in hiring me that'll
            be the end of it. I will not judge you, I will not necessarily disagree,
            but if you're not, I will look forward to meeting you, I will find you and I
            will work with you.
