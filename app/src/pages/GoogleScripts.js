            This is the least recent of my portfolio projects, but I think it's
            worth mentioning. In late 2020 I started journaling. It started out
            on a weekly basis, but over time it became a rather elaborate system
            of small daily reports, larger weekly assessments, even larger
            monthly assessments, and smaller but more introspective seasonal
            retrospectives.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            It became a bit of a hassle to copy the right template and give it
            the right name every single day and even more on sundays (which is
            when I do the larger assessments). To make it all a little easier I
            decided to learn how to automate it. You can find the Google Drive
            files, including the script, in{" "}
            <a
              target="_blank"

              className="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
            >
              this folder
            </a>. I had a go at making it all work with Google scripts and to
            my utter surprise it all worked just as intended.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I wrote the scripts in late 2021 and they haven't failed me
            yet. It's admittedly a bit funny about the week number in the first
            weeks of January, but apart from that I have had 0 issues. The only
            changes I have made have been additions for new report types. I
            haven't expanded it to copy and name the seasonal reviews yet
            because they're so infrequent. Every three months I copy it
            manually and think to myself 'I should automate that one of these
            days'; it hasn't reached the annoyance threshold.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>If I were to redesign the infrastructure of my system from
            the ground up (it's somewhere very low on the behemoth list of
            potential projects I keep somewhere in the back of my mind) I would
            probably not use Google Drive in the first place. I imagine a
            self-hosted equivalent would give me more control. I would probably
            find a storage location that allows for secure but simple cloud
            backup. I would want a file type that's either easy to edit on
            mobile, or easily integrated with a mobile interface (asciidoc). I
            would then figure out a way to automate the creation of these in a
            way that's nice and maintainable. Admittedly I would do it this way
            at first, but then ask a particularly talented classmate what they'd
            do because I probably missed plenty of opportunities for simplification.

              There are 3 main reasons I included this project in my portfolio
              <br></br>
              1. This is the first big coding project I ever did that had
              nothing to do with school. I didn't need to use Google
              Drive/Scripts for any school assignments, it's just what I found
              convenient at the time. The journaling system is for structured
              self-assesment, not for school. This project marked the beginning
              of me programming for myself as a hobby.
              <br></br>
              2. This system has held up. I still passively use it every day
              because it works well. I think that if I hadn't figured this out I
              might have been quicker to give up on using Google Drive, or just
              the journaling system in general. I'm impressed with how
              maintainable it is. I added the most recent section (effort report
              generation) in January 2023 and it took me no time at all to
              integrate it in the weekly generation process.
              <br></br>
              3. I'm blatantly advertising that I use a comprehensive system of
              journaling. I don't do it to impress anyone, but I think that for
              the right recruiter it will improve my chances.
