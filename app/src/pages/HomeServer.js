            During my internship at Prodrive Technologies I sat across from a
            fellow intern who happened to be a wizard at infrastructure and
            server management. He motivated me to get myself a server, so I
            bought an old office PC and installed Ubuntu on it.
            <br></br>
            <br></br> I managed to get an instance of Nextcloud running, but I
            couldn't easily access it externally. After months of fighting my
            housemate to get access to the right ports on the router I gave up
            and went for a Cloudflare tunnel instead.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            After that the successes came thick and fast. I quickly got deeper
            into it and startup setting up all kinds of services with Docker
            (Portainer, Node-RED, a minecraft server, deluge, emulator, grafana,
            jellyfin, influxDB, and more). At one point I decided to challenge
            myself a little and set up a Keycloak SAML client and integrate it
            with Cloudflare. My experienced colleague was genuinely impressed
            I'd managed to get it working on my own.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I can scarcely believe how quickly it went from something
            new and exciting to something I use basically every day. I watch
            fully legal media on Jellyfin, I use it for file hosting, for game
            hosting, for data collection, for development, and more. I'm
            currently typing this into VS Code with a remote connection to my
            server via SSH. This portfolio page is hosted on the server too.

              In putting together my server I gained a much deeper appreciation
              for how the internet actually works. After learning about routing
              without retaining any of it at least thrice I finally understand
              it. I now have personal experience with local routing, port
              mapping, DNS servers, domain hosting, Cloudflare, SAML, and other
              relevant subjects.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              More directly I now have enough know-how to set up any
              sufficiently simple service in a matter of minutes, which would have
              seemed fantastical to me beforehand. I will continue to
              expand my usage of my server and discover more uses for it. It has
              quickly become a hobby of mine.
