            I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are
            looking for a professional, I can tell you I don't have enough
            experience. But what I do have are a broad set of skills, skills I
            have acquired over my 3-4 years as an IT student. Skills that make
            me a potentially interesting candidate for people like you. If
            you're uninterested in hiring me that'll be the end of it. I will
            not judge you, I will not necessarily disagree, but if you're not, I
            will look forward to meeting you, I will find you and I will work
            with you.
