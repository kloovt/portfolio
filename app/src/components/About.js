            Hello, I'm Jorrit.
            <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />
            I'm an IT Student.
          </h1>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            How nice of you to take an interest in me. I'm happy that I'm
            interesting enough for you to have a look at my portfolio. If you're
            not looking to waste more time reading my attempts to be funny,
            scroll down a bit or press the projects button on the top navbar.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I'd like to point out that I'm perfectly capable of being serious. I
            just don't like writing a boilerplate introduction; it feels so
            disingenuous. I can honestly tell you I'm an enthousiastic and
            dedicated developer. I love to learn new things and see new places.
            I want to spend my time on this earth contributing to meaningful
            projects and learning as much as I can. I'm looking to work for
            companies that can give me an opportunity to develop my professional
            skills.
            <br></br>
